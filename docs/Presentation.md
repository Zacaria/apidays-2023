## Forget TypeScript

## Choose Rust to build

## Robust, Fast and Cheap APIs

---

## Typescript

- Dev UX

* Makes you forget that utimately it executes Javascript
* Makes you forget that it generates far more Javascript than you think
* Extensive type system which can block progression even if execution path is right
* Needs ecosystem support in order to not be a pain working with libraries

---

### My Opinion

- JSDoc is more than enough to reach DX without the tradeoffs
- ***

---

# "Why" : History & context

timeline

---

**Discuss why there's a need to rethink the current approach to building APIs.**

---

## TS pain points

Address the pain points with current technologies (like TypeScript).

## JSDoc is enough

---

Conclusion of timeline

Emphasize the importance of reliability, speed, and cost-effectiveness in API development.
